<title>Independent Project Proposal</title>

<body>
 For my independent project proposal, I have decided to do a remake of one of my old SMAD 203 projects. The project was a website that announced local music events that were happening or were about to happen in the Harrisonburg area. The website consisted of different restaurants, bars, and other venues that were hosting famous bands and singers to play shows. It would tell the users when and where the artists would be; everything like time, location, and date so that they could go see their favorite artists perform live. The website was entirely fictional and had the names of really big bands and singers, and I chose that topic just for fun because I am really passionate about music. I want to fix or recreate that website so that it looks nicer and more presentable for a portfolio piece, because it was one of my first websites, therefore the quality wasn’t professional. The name of the project/website will be “Local Music Finder”, the same name I gave it when I first made it. The intended audience for this website will be other JMU students who share a passion for music. It will not be limited to them however, as it will also be slightly geared towards Harrisonburg locals. My plan for this project is to have the interface improved by February 20th and all the colors and fonts fixed by March 1st, so that it will be ready to be submitted by the due date on March 6th.
